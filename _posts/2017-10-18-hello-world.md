![Hello, World!](https://dars.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1435934506-50d83ee90498b3e4f9578a58ff8b5880.png)

So... it happened.<br>
I started to write a programming (mostly, anyway) blog. Again.<br>
Wish me luck, maybe it will go better this time :)

What will be here?

{% highlight java %}
    String content(){
        return "mostly Java";
    }
{% endhighlight %}

but also some others. I don't really know...<br>
Maybe if I kept reporting what I do, I would not be searching for the same stuff over and over again...<br>

And to be brutally honest - I just wanted to play around with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) :D<br>
It's kind of awesome that I can create simple web pages for free with just MD files!<br>
And no, they did not pay me to write that. It's just that cool!
