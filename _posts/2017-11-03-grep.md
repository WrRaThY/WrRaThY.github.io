Well, I don't know.  
It's not like I don't use it. I have to use it every now and then. Usually at least once a week...  
But for some reason it slips my mind every single time.
So in order to stop googling it again and again I can just have it here.   
Maybe it will also help someone else :)

so here goes nothing.
To find all files containing specific text on Linux you just need to execute something like that
	
	grep -Rnwil '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
	grep -Rnwil '.' -e 'RollbackException'
	  
	explanations:
		    -R = recursive.
		    -n = line number
		    -w = match the whole word
		    -i = ignore case
		    -l = (small L) show the file name, not the result itself
