I could try to tell all about my passion to programming, bits, bytes, Strings, Streams, Architecture and so on... but describing myself is always a pain and you don't really 
want to waste time reading this...  
I could also write why there is "madness" in the title, but I'm afraid you'll get that after reading any post.  
Basically... A lot of stuff pisses me off. Mostly stuff that should be optimized somehow and is not, because people are lazy. And stupid. Or Both. or something else...  
Then again, I usually tend to turn my anger into laughter, so you won't read rants without a point. The point is to make you smile. At least a bit ;]   

That said, I'll just give you link to places where you can find me
